Calculates the total FTAs per team over a season, for home and away, plots results to examine strength of relation. Also calculates the average FTAs by each team occurring in games officiated by each ref. Box plot to examine distribution of ref averages.

**FTA_Refs_v_Teams.py**
Produces heatmap of FTAs given to each team by each ref. (Refs ranked by average FTA/game desc and teams ranked by average FTA/game desc).
